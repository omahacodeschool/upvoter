# Upvoter

This is a Reddit-like news sharing website for the students of Omaha Code School. Anyone with login credentials can submit tutorials, articles, videos, etc that they think would be meaningful to current students or alumni. Like with Reddit, stories can be upvoted (or downvoted!) and rise/fall on the basis of those votes.

## Tech Stack

The site is built in Sinatra and stores data in a CSV file.
